# Game-of-Life

The rules for the Game of Life, perhaps the most famous cellular automaton,
are simple: a cell has only  two states, dead or alive, it comes to life when it has
three neighbours, it needs two or three neighbours to stay alive and it can die
due to over- or underpopulation. Complex behaviour can emerge even from the
simplest of configurations.
